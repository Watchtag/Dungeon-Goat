# Dungeon-Goat
A (mostly*) working version of  seraphim291_'s Dungeon Goats resource pack.    </br>
based on the code of Visual Screaming Goats on PMC                             </br>
(*baby goats do not have the stumpy horns they have in Minecraft Dungeons)     </br>

<h2>*Resource pack requires EMF*</h2>
